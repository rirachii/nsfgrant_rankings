About
--

NSF Grants Rankings is inspired by csrankings.org, which ranks institutions based on the number of publications by faculty that have appeared at the most selective conferences. NSF Grants Rankings acquires data from nsf.gov to rank institutions in the USA based on the total amount of funding rewarded.

Data
--

Data is downloaded from https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/download.jsp where each entry/grant is stored in an XML file.
There were many bad file where:
* Some name the people as institutions
* Some have no investigators
* Some aren’t a university but companies instead.
These files had to be filtered out along with the grants for small sub-areas as there was only a few grants rewarded to them.

Currently, the XML data for 2000-2022 has been parsed and are stored in a SQLite3 database, nsf_grant_data.db which includes two tables:

_2000_2022: | id | abr | amt | faculty | institution_name | start_year | awardID |


institution:
   | id | institution_name |


Improvement Plan
--

* Responsive designs
* Include data from 1990-1999
* Add a search filter for institutions.

   Start the server on its own with the command:

   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

   Run the React application on its own with the command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Run both applications together with the command:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The React application will run on port 3000 and the server port 5000.
