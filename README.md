# Start the server

   You can start the server on its own with the command:

   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

   Run the React application on its own with the command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Run both applications together with the command:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The React application will run on port 3000 and the server port 5000.
